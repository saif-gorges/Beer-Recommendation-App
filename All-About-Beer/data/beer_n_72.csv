Yikes, this is awful.  Basically tastes like a beverage that’s 60% mediocre lager and 40% water.  If you want to save money with very little drawback in return, drink just the water.

95 calories for this beer. Not only is it a low carb beer, but it will probably cause you to yack up any carbs or food you previously consumed. A step above Corrs Light taste-wise.
