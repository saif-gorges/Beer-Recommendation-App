Good - highly drinkable. I only had a little sample but I’m looking forward to going back and getting a full pint. Had a nice dark copper color and slightly sweet aroma.

A little carmelly, and chewy.  Not that good.  A watery backbone.  It was either this, regular guiness, or bud on tap.  So, we went with this, not bad, not great.

This is the beer I dream about. 1st pint in McDermotts pub in Dulin Ireland. More flavour than Guinness (and I love Guinness) and a better finish.

Another fave of mine. You can't go wrong with this stuff. I agree, it has a Newcastle-like level of quality.

Not much to say about this, a very good creme ale.  Slightly darker than usual, and I found it to be a bit above average as far as these go.

Not a lot of carbonation, which is a good thing.  Nice taste, good substitute if there is no Newcastle Brown Ale around.

Reasonably malty; the one beer Guinness makes that they don't ruin with nitrogen.
