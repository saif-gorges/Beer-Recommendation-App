Fairly ordinary German pilsner. A little watery with no particularly interesting bitterness. May well go in the category easily drunk beer.

0,5 l bottle and on tap. An absolute classic. Medium carbo, stable white head. Aromas of hops and malt. Earthy and refreshing but still kind of extra-class pilsner. Great.
