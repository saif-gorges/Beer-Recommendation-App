Got a hot Thai dish on the table? Well serve up the Tiger, and be quick about it.  Well, it has low fizz and doesn't leave you bloaty, which is essential when eating spicy food.

This beer is crisp and quenching and it goes down surprisingly easy but the flavour is not very profound (despite a sugary, overforceful aftertaste)

This is by far the best beer around.  I grew up in Singapore and I was raised on Tiger, so that might explain why I like it so much.  Nothing beats a tall cold tiger draft on a hot night.…

Straight forward lager.  No hints of anything significant.  I didn't detect any of the fruit hints.

Pale yellow.  Odd esters in the nose - pear, green apple - always a sign of a failed lager.  Light and watery, with some slight fusel influence.  Unclean, hopless, a total drain pour.
